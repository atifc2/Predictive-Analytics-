** This project is done by using an e-commerce dataset of women's cloths. 

** Logistic Regression, KNN, & Naive Bayes were used as ML algorithms for predicting customer reviews. 

** Textblob was also used to find out the sentiments of customers (Positive, Negative, Neutral)

** Steps are clearly mentioned in the code shell with comments


An Overview - 

1. Load necessary libraries as mentioned
2. Load dataset

4. Split the dataset into train and test dataset
5. Fit into the dataset
6. Predict
7. Accuracy

*** Different models have given different accuracy
*** This project can also be done by using other ML algorithms.
